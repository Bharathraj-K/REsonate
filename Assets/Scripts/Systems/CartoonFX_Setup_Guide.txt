SETTING UP CARTOON FX SHOCKWAVE EFFECTS FOR OVERLOAD MODE

1. IMPORT CARTOON FX REMASTER FREE:
   - Get from Unity Asset Store
   - Import the package into your project
   - Navigate to CartoonFX/Prefabs folder

2. RECOMMENDED SHOCKWAVE EFFECTS:
   From Cartoon FX Remaster Free, these work well for shockwaves:
   
   - CFXR_Explosion_A_Smoke: Large explosion with smoke
   - CFXR_Explosion_B_Smoke: Alternative explosion style
   - CFXR_Shockwave_A: Pure shockwave ring effect
   - CFXR_Shockwave_B: Alternative shockwave with particles
   - CFXR_Magic_A: Magical energy burst
   - CFXR_Magic_B: Alternative magical effect
   - CFXR_ElectricExplosion_A: Electric-themed explosion

3. SETUP IN OVERLOADMODE:
   - Select OverloadMode GameObject in scene
   - In Inspector, find "Visual Effects" section
   - Drag chosen effect from Prefabs folder to "Shockwave Effect Prefab" field
   - Adjust settings:
     * Shockwave Effect Duration: 3-5 seconds
     * Shockwave Effect Scale: 1.0-2.0 (based on your shockwave radius)

4. FINE-TUNING SETTINGS:
   
   Scale Recommendations:
   - Shockwave Radius 15 → Effect Scale 1.0
   - Shockwave Radius 20 → Effect Scale 1.3  
   - Shockwave Radius 10 → Effect Scale 0.7

   Duration Recommendations:
   - Fast action game: 2-3 seconds
   - Dramatic effect: 4-5 seconds
   - Minimal distraction: 1-2 seconds

5. AUDIO INTEGRATION (Optional):
   - Add AudioSource component to OverloadMode GameObject
   - Assign audio clips:
     * Overload Activation Sound: Dramatic power-up sound
     * Shockwave Sound: Explosion or energy burst sound
   - Recommended volume: 0.7-1.0 for dramatic effect

6. TESTING YOUR SETUP:
   - Use OverloadModeDebugger to quickly test effects
   - Press F6 to force activate overload
   - Check console for: "Created prefab shockwave effect at [position]"
   - If you see "Using fallback primitive shockwave", the prefab isn't assigned

7. CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS:
   
   For Different Game Styles:
   - Sci-Fi: CFXR_ElectricExplosion_A + metallic sounds
   - Fantasy: CFXR_Magic_A/B + mystical sounds  
   - Military: CFXR_Explosion_A_Smoke + explosion sounds
   - Minimalist: CFXR_Shockwave_A + subtle whoosh sound

8. TROUBLESHOOTING:
   
   Effect Not Appearing:
   - Check prefab is assigned in inspector
   - Verify prefab has ParticleSystem components
   - Check console for error messages
   
   Effect Too Small/Large:
   - Adjust "Shockwave Effect Scale" value
   - Scale should roughly match your shockwave radius
   
   Effect Disappears Too Quickly:
   - Increase "Shockwave Effect Duration"
   - Some effects have built-in auto-destroy timers
   
   No Sound:
   - Ensure AudioSource component exists on OverloadMode GameObject
   - Check audio clips are assigned
   - Verify AudioSource is not muted

9. PERFORMANCE NOTES:
   - Cartoon FX effects are optimized for performance
   - Multiple particle systems may impact framerate on low-end devices  
   - Consider simpler effects for mobile builds
   - Effects auto-cleanup after duration expires

10. ALTERNATIVE EFFECTS:
    If you don't have Cartoon FX Remaster Free:
    - Unity's built-in particle systems work too
    - Create custom shockwave prefabs with ParticleSystem
    - The fallback primitive effect will be used automatically

EXAMPLE SETUP:
1. Import Cartoon FX Remaster Free
2. Drag "CFXR_Shockwave_A" to Shockwave Effect Prefab field
3. Set Duration to 3 seconds, Scale to 1.5
4. Add explosion sound clip
5. Test with F6 key in play mode
